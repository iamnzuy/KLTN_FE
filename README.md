## ReUI Components

Storely now leverages [ReUI](https://reui.io), our open-source React component library.

Star the [ReUI on GitHub](https://github.com/keenthemes/reui) to help us grow the project and stay updated on new features!

### Installation

To set up the project dependencies, including those required for React 19, use the `--force` flag to resolve any dependency conflicts:

```bash
npm install --force
```

### Database Deployment via [Prisma](https://prisma.io)

This will create the necessary tables in database for user authorization and user management apps :

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

Once your schema is deployed, you need to generate the Prisma Client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```
